# Reactive Programming in Java with Flux and Mono

This repository showcases my journey through a Reactive Programming course centered around Java, with a primary focus on using Flux and Mono from the Reactor library. Here are the key details:

- **Course**: Reactive Programming in Java with Flux and Mono
- **Instructor**: Java Brains

## Key Takeaways

Throughout the course, I honed my skills in leveraging Flux and Mono to handle asynchronous data streams and reactive programming concepts in Java:

1. **Flux and Mono Mastery**: Gained proficiency in working with Flux (for handling multiple values) and Mono (for handling single values) to manage asynchronous data streams effectively.

2. **Functional Reactive Programming (FRP)**: Embraced FRP principles to express intricate asynchronous logic in a concise and declarative manner using Flux and Mono.

3. **Concurrency and Parallelism**: Explored strategies for managing concurrency and parallelism efficiently with Flux and Mono in Java.

4. **Error Handling**: Acquired expertise in error handling techniques with Flux and Mono to ensure robust and reliable Java applications.

## Application

This knowledge can be applied to Java projects using Flux and Mono:

- **Scalability**: Enables the development of scalable and high-performance Java applications by efficiently handling asynchronous data streams.

- **Reduced Complexity**: Simplifies code, making it more maintainable and readable through declarative programming with Flux and Mono.

- **Responsiveness**: Enhances user interface responsiveness within Java applications by leveraging reactive programming principles.

- **Error Resilience**: Ensures Java applications gracefully handle failures and errors, maintaining a superior user experience.
